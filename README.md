# Maze Generator

This project implements a maze generator using a backtracking algorithm.

## Overview

The maze generator creates mazes with interconnected passages, allowing for exploration and navigation. 
It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to efficiently generate mazes with dead ends and loops.
